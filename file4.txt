Be a leader where ever you go 
Imagine you are in a group of people working  on a project 
given to you by an organization or company or may be by a lecturer, 
as a transformative leader you have to come up and stand as a mobiliser 
even before even  being elected, you to be creative here out every one in
 the group, knowing every one’s weakness and strength and as well as promoting 
a strong team work in the group. You have to know who is good at which thing and 
not at which thing and ensure you to deliver in time as told.
